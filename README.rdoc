This is a sample application that complements http://github.com/yar/i18n_db - a Rails-2.2 internationalization backend.

The app demonstrates administrative interface for translators.

After checking out, do not forget to run:

git submodule init
git submodule update

so that vendor/rails and vendor/plugins/i18n_db get populated.
